## Vim-like Keybindings
## Note: Nano doesn't support true vim modes, but we can add some familiar bindings

# Navigation (using Alt as prefix for vim-like commands)
# Alt+h, Alt+j, Alt+k, Alt+l for left, down, up, right
bind ^H back main           # Ctrl+H: back (like h in vim)
bind ^J down main           # Ctrl+J: down (like j in vim)  
bind ^K up main             # Ctrl+K: up (like k in vim)
bind ^L forward main        # Ctrl+L: forward (like l in vim)

# Word navigation
bind M-b prevword main      # Alt+b: previous word

bind ^E end main            # Ctrl+E: end of line (like $ in vim)

# Delete operations (more vim-like)

bind M-p paste main         # Alt+p: paste (like p in vim)
bind ^T cut main            # Ctrl+T: cut (similar to d in vim)

# Visual mode simulation
bind M-v mark main          # Alt+v: start selection (like v in vim)

# Indentation
bind M-] indent main        # Alt+]: indent (like >> in vim)
bind M-[ unindent main      # Alt+[: unindent (like << in vim)

# Window/Buffer operations
bind M-n nextbuf main       # Alt+n: next buffer (like :bn in vim)
bind M-p prevbuf main       # Alt+p: previous buffer (like :bp in vim)

# Comments
# Nano doesn't have vim's command mode (:), but these bindings provide
# some muscle-memory-compatible shortcuts for common operations.
#
# Quick Reference (Most Useful):
# --------------------------------
# Ctrl+J/K         - Up/Down (like j/k in vim)

# Ctrl+D           - Delete char (like x in vim)
# Alt+v            - Start selection (like v in vim)
